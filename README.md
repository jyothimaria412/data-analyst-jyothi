# Project 2: Exploratory Analysis]
# Project 3: DAP Impementation
- Project Description
  The dataset used is the Business Licence 2024 dataset for March. It contains information about various businesses including their type, license status, and other related details. This dataset is critical for analyzing business trends, compliance, and other useful information.
- Data Enriching
- I have started with Data enriching. I have a structured dataset and in this step, we used Amazon Athena to run a SQL query on a dataset stored in the AWS Data Catalog. The query counts the number of records where the business_type column equals "Office." This step ensures that the enriched dataset filtered and ready for further analysis or reporting.
This query was necessary to focus specifically on the "Office" business type. Data enrichment involves refining the data by filtering or transforming it to meet specific needs. By using this segment, we could prepare the dataset for detailed analysis relevant to business needs or reporting goals. It is found that there is a total count of 123 business license which is issued in the office type segment in Vancouver for 2024 for the month of March.
